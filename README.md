## Description

This application was created for someone who is going on a trip and just needs a simple five day forecast and current weather to plan their trip accordingly. I built this project because I wanted to learn more about APIs and since I travel a lot, it will definitely be put to good use. It's a simple app that just provides the need-to-know information without all the other things not needed for planning a quick trip. I learned lots about fetching data from APIs, as well as lots about JavaScript again.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This weather dashboard is just a click away from preparing you for the week ahead and getting your rainboots out of the closet. To use this dashboard, simply enter a city and the current weather and the following five days' weather will populate. Search history will be saved for future use.
